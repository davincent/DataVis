    "### Global EV Charging Stations\n",
    "This dataset contains 242,418 rows of electric vehicle charging stations worldwide from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tarekmasryo/global-ev-charging-stations/data). The data was pulled from [Open Charge Map](https://map.openchargemap.io/#/search) through an API. The feartures I will be focusing on will be the country_code, city, ports, power_kw, and power_class coloumns. I found this dataset interesting because on of my biggest worries about electric vehicle adoption is the lack of infrastructure relative to that of traditional combustion-engine vehicles.\n",
