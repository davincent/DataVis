    "\n",
    "* 1980s: Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s, at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands.\n",
    "* 1991: The first official version, Python 0.9.0, was released in February 1991. This version already included many features familiar to today's Python programmers, including exception handling, functions, and modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naming: \n",
    "\n",
    "* The name \"Python\" was not derived from the snake, but rather as a tribute to the British comedy group \"Monty Python,\" whose work Guido van Rossum enjoyed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evolution:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 1994: Python 1.0 was officially released, marking a significant milestone for the language. It included important features like lambda, map, filter, and reduce.\n",
    "* 2000: Python 2.0 was released, introducing list comprehensions and garbage collection. One of the most significant additions in the Python 2 series was the introduction of the \"new-style classes\" in Python 2.2.\n",
    "* 2008: Python 3.0 (often called \"Python 3000\" or \"Py3k\") was released. It was designed to rectify fundamental flaws of the language. This version was not backward compatible with Python 2, which was a significant and somewhat controversial decision. Key changes included the print statement becoming a function (print()), integer division producing a float instead of an integer, and the introduction of the bytes type for handling binary data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Legacy of Python 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Even after the release of Python 3, Python 2 continued to be widely used. However, to move the community forward, the PSF announced that support for Python 2.7 (the last release in the 2.x series) would end in 2020.\n",
    "* After January 1, 2020, Python 2 received no updates, even for security issues."
