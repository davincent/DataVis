    "# Visualizing relationships between categorical features - A/B Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "A/B testing, also known as split testing, is a method used to compare two versions of a web page, application, advertisement, or other marketing material to determine which one performs better. The essence of an A/B test is to conduct a controlled experiment with two variants, A and B, where A typically represents the current version (control), and B is the new version (test).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components of A/B Testing:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis Formation:** Before conducting an A/B test, a clear hypothesis is formed, predicting how the change in version B will impact a specific metric compared to version A.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Randomized Assignment:** Users are randomly assigned to either the control group (A) or the test group (B) to eliminate selection bias. This randomization ensures that each group is statistically similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Control and Variation:** The control group experiences the original version (A), while the variation group experiences the new version (B). The difference between these versions might be something as small as a color change in a button or as significant as a complete redesign.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Measurement and Data Collection:** Data is collected on how users interact with each version. Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as conversion rates, click-through rates, engagement metrics, or other relevant metrics are measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Statistical Analysis:** The results are analyzed statistically to determine if there is a significant difference in performance between the two versions. Tools like t-tests or analysis of variance (ANOVA) are commonly used for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision Making:** Based on the outcome of the analysis, a decision is made whether to adopt the new version, keep the existing one, or run additional tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications of A/B Testing:\n",
    "\n",
    "A/B testing is widely used in various fields such as marketing, web design, product development, and even in policy-making. In e-commerce, for instance, it can help determine the most effective design for a product page to maximize sales. In digital marketing, it can identify the most compelling ad copy to improve click-through rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of A/B Testing:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data-Driven Decisions:** It helps in making decisions based on actual user data rather than assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Improved User Engagement:** By testing different versions, one can understand what works best for the audience.\n",
